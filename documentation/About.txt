CRUZ-RABE MATERNITY & GENERAL HOSPITAL

37 General Luna St., Tuktukan Taguig City, NCR
About CRMGH Cruz-Rabe Maternity & General Hospital was accredited as one of the secondary hospital in Taguig City and located at 37 General Luna St., Tuktukan Taguig City. The hospital itself is a two storey building that can accommodate 30 bed rooms over 50 patients. Cruz-Rabe Maternity & General Hospital was categorized as a private class hospital in Taguig City and owned by a family corporation. The hospital has associate subsidiaries namely; South Super Highway Medical Centre, the main hospital which can do major unitary operations. And the last one is General Trias Satellite Hospital, which is a gateway hospital in Cavite. These 3 hospitals were owned by Dr. Jose Casimiro Rabe, a family doctor and his wife Dra. Erlinda Cruz Rabe an ob-gyne. Cruz-Rabe Maternity & General Hospital had addressed its main problem particularly on the Pharmacy Booth section and which we think our project team can contribute a solution to their dilemma. Specifically, we proposed a system for the automation of their “Manual Process of Pharmacy Requests.”
